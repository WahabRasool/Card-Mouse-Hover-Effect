                      <h3>Rose</h3>
                      <p>A type of flowering shrub, its name comes from the Latin word Rosa. The rose has been
                        a symbol of love, beauty, war, and
                        politics. The rose plant can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that
                        are often armed with sharp
                        prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colors
                        ranging from white through yellows
                        and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe,
                        North America, and northwestern
                        Africa.Roses are often grown as ornamental plants for their beautiful and sometimes
                        fragrant flowers. They are popular garden
                        plants but are sometimes grown indoors and are used as cut flowers.The rose species,
                        China rose (Rosa chinensis), has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. The
                        roots and fruits are
                        used for arthritis, joint pains, coughs, and skin wounds and infections. The flower
                        buds are used to stimulate blood
                        flow and help with chest and abdominal pain.Rose water is commonly used in Middle
                        Eastern and Indian cooking, especially in sweets such as baklava, nougat, and
                        Turkish delight.</p>

                      <h3>Tulip</h3>
                      <p>Tulips are spring-blooming perennials that grow from bulbs. Depending on the species,
                        tulip plants can grow as short as
                        4 inches (10 cm) or as high as 28 inches (71 cm). The tulip's large flowers usually
                        bloom on scapes or subscapose stems
                        that lack bracts. Most tulips produce only one flower per stem, but a few species
                        bear multiple flowers on their scapes
                        (e.g., Tulipa turkestanica). The showy, generally cup- or star-shaped tulip flower
                        has three petals and three sepals,
                        which are often termed tepals because they are nearly identical.Tulip bulbs are
                        measured in centimeters around the "waist" of the bulb. Longfield Gardens supplies
                        tulip bulbs that are
                        at least 12cm in circumference. This ensures you will always get the biggest,
                        brightest blooms.Tulip bulbs should be planted in mid to late fall, any time after
                        the first frost and before the ground freezes. For
                        best results, plant the bulbs within a month after you receive them.Plant tulip
                        bulbs 6" to 8" deep and 4" to 5" apart on center. You may plant the bulbs
                        individually, or can dig out a
                        larger area and plant a number of bulbs at once. Position the bulbs with the pointy
                        end up and then cover them with
                        soil. Fall and winter rains usually provide adequate moisture. Water only if the
                        weather is very dry.</p>

                      <h3>Sunflower</h3>
                      <p>Sunflowers are known for being “happy” flowers, making them the perfect gift to bring
                        joy to someone’s (or your) day.The common sunflower has a green erect stem covered
                        in coarse hairs, growing on average around 2m tall. The leaves are
                        broad, with serrated edges, and are alternately arranged on the stem. The ‘flower’
                        of the common sunflower is actually a
                        pseudanthium, or flowerhead, made up of many small flowers. The outer yellow
                        ‘petals’ on the flowerhead are known as ray
                        flowers and are made up of multiple petals fused together. Ray petals are usually
                        yellow but can sometimes be red or
                        orange. The black-brown flowers in the centre of the head, called disk flowers, grow
                        in a spiral formation, and mature
                        into sunflower seeds over time.Sunflower seeds are processed to create sunflower
                        oil, a cooking oil that is both cheap to produce and high in
                        unsaturated fats.Sunflower seeds are eaten both raw and roasted as a snack. They can
                        also be processed to create sunflower butter, an
                        alternative to peanut butter.Sunflower oil can be processed into margarine.Some
                        Native American peoples use ground sunflower seeds to make bread-like products.Did
                        you know? Sunflower petals are edible, but they aren't widely eaten due to their
                        flavour.</p>

                      <h3>Daisy</h3>
                      <p>Daisies are simple yet sophisticated and are some of the most beautiful flowers in
                        the floral world.Daisy plants often grow to about 2 to 3 feet (61 to 91 centimeters)
                        tall. The flowers grow on long stalks. Two types of
                        flower make up each flower head. Ray flowers are what people call petals. The ray
                        flowers may be long or short. Tiny
                        disk flowers make up the center. The center may be flat or rounded. Depending on the
                        type of daisy, the flower heads are
                        from 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10 centimeters) wide.Oxeye and Shasta daisies have a ring
                        of white ray flowers around a bright yellow center. The ray flowers of the English
                        daisy may be white, purple, pink, or red.With its soft, pearly white petals
                        radiating from a golden center, the Shasta daisy is a timeless classic. Not is it
                        only one of the largest daisies, but it is also one of the easiest to grow and care
                        for. Plus, you can enjoy its hearty
                        blooms season after season.The sweet simplicity and genuine beauty of the daisy have
                        made the flower an international emblem of innocence and
                        purity. Its fresh, crisp appearance has come to symbolize new beginnings, and its
                        bright, spirit-lifting colors are
                        known to spread happiness like wildfire. It’s for these reasons that daisies make
                        the perfect gifts and decorations for
                        celebrating all of life’s biggest milestone events.</p>

                      <h3>Orchid</h3>
                      <p>Orchids are delicate, exotic and graceful. They represent love, luxury, beauty and
                        strength.Orchids are plants prized for their beautiful and unique flowers. Orchids
                        make up one of the world’s largest plant
                        families, with between 15,000 and 35,000 species, or types. Many people grow orchids
                        as a hobby.
                        Orchids grow in most parts of the world except for the areas near the North and
                        South poles. Most orchids prefer warm,
                        tropical areas. Orchids can grow in soil, completely underground, or on other plants
                        or rocks. The species that grow on
                        other plants or rocks do not have their roots in soil. Instead, their roots dangle
                        in the air or cling to the plant or
                        rock. They get moisture and nutrients from rainwater, rotting plant matter, or the
                        air.
                        Orchid plants can measure from less than an inch (2.5 centimeters) to more than 15
                        feet (4.6 meters) tall. There can be
                        a single flower or clusters. The flowers can be as small as 0.1 inch (2.5
                        millimeters) or as large as 15 inches (38
                        centimeters) across. They can be almost any color, and some have spots or streaks.
                        Many have a strong fragrance, or
                        smell, but some have no fragrance at all.
                        The flavoring known as vanilla comes from the seedpods of some orchid plants. It is
                        used in baked goods and beverages,
                        and it is an ingredient in perfumes as well.</p>

                      <h3>Chrysanthemum</h3>
                      <p>Chrysanthemum flowers come in a variety of sizes, ranging from 5 to 8 centimeters in
                        diameter. Chrysanthemums are
                        composite flowers that grow in varying petal arrangements, with some types having a
                        daisy-like structure, others having
                        a rounder, pompom-like appearance, and even some blooms with quill-like petals. The
                        blossoms also have varying hues,
                        from white and light yellow to deep burgundies and purples. Chrysanthemums have a
                        sweet and floral scent with notes of
                        menthol that clear the nasal passages. The flavor profile of Chrysanthemums may
                        differ depending on the variety, but
                        commonly the blossoms have bitter and floral nuances with sweet and peppery
                        undertones.Chrysanthemum flower is the generalized term for thousands of commonly
                        grown perennials, affectionately known as mums.
                        These species of flowering plants are members of the daisy family and bloom in a
                        vast array of colors and shapes. All
                        mum flowers are edible, with the most common variety, pictured above, being Garland
                        chrysanthemums, botanically
                        classified as Chrysanthemum coronarium. This variety is also grown for its leafy
                        greens and succulent stems, known as
                        Shungiku in many Asian cultures. Garland chrysanthemums are one of the only
                        varieties whose greens are edible. Other
                        species of Chrysanthemum greens can cause contact dermatitis when handled without
                        gloves and may result in digestive
                        irritation when consumed. Chrysanthemum flowers produce a natural pesticide that
                        helps with pest control in home gardens
                        but is also toxic to household pests. Throughout history, Chrysanthemums have been a
                        symbol of love, life, and rebirth.
                        They are often gifted at baby showers and birthdays and are placed as offerings to
                        the Goddess Lakshmi during Diwali
                        Puja in Hindu culture. Mums are one of the most used edible flowers today, elevating
                        the color, texture, dimension, and
                        flavor of many different culinary creations.</p>
